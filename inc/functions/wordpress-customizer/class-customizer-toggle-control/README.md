# WordPress Customizer Toggle Control

A generic toggle control you can use to replace the checkbox control.

## Demo

I've added this control to my [customizer demo theme](https://github.com/soderlind/2016-customizer-demo).

## Installing the control

Clone this repository and include the class:

```php
/**
 * Check for WP_Customizer_Control existence before adding custom control because WP_Customize_Control
 * is loaded on customizer page only
 *
 * @see _wp_customize_include()
 */
if ( class_exists( 'WP_Customize_Control' ) ) {
	require_once( dirname(__FILE) . '/class-customizer-toggle-control.php' );
}
```

## Adding the control

```php
$wp_customize->add_control( new Customizer_Toggle_Control( $wp_customize, 'my_control', array(
		'label'	      => esc_html__( 'Toggle me on or off', 'my-lang' ),
		'section'     => 'my_section',
		'settings'    => 'my_setting',
		'type'        => 'ios',// light, ios, flat
) ) );
```
Three different types are available

## Toggling the control title

You must update the [js/customizer-toggle-control.js](js/customizer-toggle-control.js#L10-L15) file if you want to change the title color when a toggle is disabled/enabled.
